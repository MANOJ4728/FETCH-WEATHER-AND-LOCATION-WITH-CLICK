How to Use
When you open the web app, click the "Click me" button to detect your IP address and location.

The app will display the city where your IP address is located.

You will also see weather details for that location, including temperature, humidity, pressure, and a weather description.

An icon representing the current weather condition will be displayed.

Dependencies
This app uses the IP API to detect your IP address and location.

Weather data is fetched from OpenWeatherMap using their API.

Customization
You can customize the weather icons by mapping different weather conditions to Font Awesome icons in the JavaScript code.

Adjust the font size of the weather icon in the CSS code to make it bigger or smaller according to your preference.
